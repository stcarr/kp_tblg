Tools for construction of a relaxed TBG Hamiltonian and kp extraction
----------

- parameter_extract_job.m: A full run of kp terms for variables defined 
              in the file "global_vars.m"

- global_vars.m: Parameters which control the parameter extraction job

- run_script.sh/run_script_local.sh: SLURM style scripts that run 
              parameter_extract_job.m

folders:

tbh_construct: Constructs the TBG supercell Hamiltonian (with relaxations)
tbh_bands: Calculates band structure of tbh model
kp_fit: Does a symmetrized fitting of the plane-wave overlaps for use in kp_tblg
kp_bands: calculates band structure of kp model
post_proc: compares bands between TBH and final kp models

anglesweep_ext_01-06-2019: Full run of the kp term extraction used in this code
